Hi, humans.

Atomic-Umbrella here.
I enjoy subway(eat flesh), computers(obviously), TACOS, The oatmeal (check him out here http://theoatmeal.com) and Java. I spend most of my time probably similar to you, slouched in front of a computer but you probably know that already. In this repository I will be trying to learn and further my love for Java. The only thing I will be making is little games and programs that I enjoyed making, using or I just feel really proud about them.
